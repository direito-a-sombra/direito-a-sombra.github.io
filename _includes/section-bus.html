        The excess of light reveals climate injustices. Why haven't we built cities where shadow (or shade!)
        is a public infrastructure, and a social environmental right? Brazilian modern cities (and many cities
        around the world) were not planned for people, for animals, nor for rivers or trees.

        Ms. Liduina, the woman in this photo, hides behind a thin pole shade while waiting for the bus.
        She commutes daily. Like many other workers. Or students. Kids, elderly.

        What if urban infrastructure were reimagined through living systems — if a specific tree species
        signaled a bus stop, replacing the built shelter (when there is one) with shade itself?

        That image served as the primary reference for this experimental research tool. Based on it,
        together with a city list, we developed a platform to scan all bus stops in Fortaleza using
        Google Street View, applying machine learning to analyze people, trees, and shadows in more than 4,000 images.

        Do not hesitate to explore the bus stops in Fortaleza and draw your own conclusions.
